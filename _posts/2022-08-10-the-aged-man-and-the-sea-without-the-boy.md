From the last blog I was told how Heminway has died and so in the next 19 pages and further I might be influenced in perspective, but I also gained this new perspective where sometimes going in blind and being surprised in life is better than to know it all. Everybody should learn to be naive, to be afraid and to seek foolishness. Nothing wrong with that.
When reading these pages it felt like no time at all has passed. You might not wonder what an old man at the sea can have happen and yet there is suspense, there is lick of the lip.
I notice a loneliness in the need for someone and the repeated self given words, wimping for the boy that is not here, yet he knows what he has to do, what he was born to do and which is the right way to die. Strong but simple reminders push the reading forward, they make you feel sure and steady. There is serenity in the story telling, a future that could be foretold. 
Finding it very interesting how, if it tries to guess, it can find clues about what a human is thinking, bits about what was in somebody's life, his/her perspective of some things, silluettes of some meaningful people; through the work, the art or the writtings of anyone. Simple details are easy to miss or even intentionally fabricated to make you feel
a certain way, everything can be intuitive and nothing can be certain.
