In this very first blog of mine and the very first personal project, I will try to express myself in a manner that I, myself, would find interesting when reading it; and fail miserably. I've read 25 page of "The old man and the sea" and now I will lay my opinions on the writer's vision in the first quarter of this book. <br> <br>
The first thing I noticed from the very first pages is the way this story is written, very descriptive, but very short phrases. This way of writing was sort of unsettling for me. The naration, that takes place in my head while learning about the characters and the world, is very jerky and gives the perect setting in this sort of simple world with the old man, the boy and the sea, almost making me read to myself as if I am reading to a little kid. The dialogue doesn't refract from this, the characters answering each other in singular setences. It feels as if you're giving me more than I am actually reading!

I honestly can't wait to read the next part of this book tomorrow, to find out more about the meek and deceptively simple old man, the kind boy and what will happen out in this sea, in which the word "sea" alone can drift you very far into the mysterious light blue sky or the dark blue waters that can hide wonders or terrors and to 
never be able to know what a story can lay for you. Thinking and writing about this book, which should be read in one go, while also taking a tormeting break every 20 or so pages, makes me feel maudlin and enhances the "real" of the setting Hemingway tries to convey. Empathizing with the "refresh" the old man feels every day even if he didn't catch any fish, is heart-warming.
