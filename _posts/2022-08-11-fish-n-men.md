The middle 19 pages are a fishing game. I divert from the plot with ambiguity so as to not spoil anything. To be sincere, and sincerity dwells in writting; I find it harder to write about the middle of a book, or I might have a bland day (but that also isn't true). I might just be filling a blog with my thoughts due to lack of ideas, maybe this is what Fyodor always does in the beginning of his books, just that it's a normality. I could talk about the lack of salt, yet the old man is kind of a sweety. I'm probably ruining Hemingway's intentions. I could say that it has very much of the same happenings or "as we ferret further into the story, in to the end, we notice a shift".
As I try to dicipline myself, so does the story. Parallels can be found anywhere, yet, oddly, nowhere as uninteresting as here. You can always wonder what would happen if a teacher gave you a homework, and the homework is an essay about a book, and you do the homework, and you show some things of the sort I'm webbing about in here.
So I digress; the story makes it harder and harder to let go, as if it wasn't hard enough for such a short book. We are at sea and I'm just fishing for the biggest word (up). I just can't wait to read the next pages. Believe all is true.
