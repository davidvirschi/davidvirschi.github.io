<meta name="description" content="I have finished the book and the ending is inspired by a real life event of the author, this is why I kind of knew how it would end. The idea I extract from this: I merely find it interesting the value of a trophy or a deed done, the same way it’s value is merely personal and yet connect to the outside world. What value does a personal achievement have if you live in a cave and have never interacted with another human being? It’s a question without an answer because I can only imagine seeking no such values when all alone with nature and animals. The old man remains with a respectable story known by those important to him. If I were to imagine the story after the end is the old man and the boy fishing once more and no more bad luck could fall upon them. Only good days ahead and no story to tell, remaining only something personal, but still meaningful. Same with this blog, what I have after this is more than a simple blog. I learned to write, to discipline myself and to think not only for myself, but how I am seen by myself in 3rd person and how others see me. Somehow connecting thoughts in the inefficiency of writing about fragments of a book and fragments of random ideas that fly in my head, trying to order them all in this blog. What I remain with is the wish to talk to whoever reads this blog and to develop a connection, or an idea." />
