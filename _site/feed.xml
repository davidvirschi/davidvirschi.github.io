I divert from the plot with ambiguity so as to not spoil anything. To be sincere, and sincerity dwells in writting; I find it harder to write about the middle of a book, or I might have a bland day (but that also isn’t true). I might just be filling a blog with my thoughts due to lack of ideas, maybe this is what Fyodor always does in the beginning of his books, just that it’s a normality. I could talk about the lack of salt, yet the old man is kind of a sweety. I’m probably ruining Hemingway’s intentions. I could say that it has very much of the same happenings or “as we ferret further into the story, in to the end, we notice a shift”.
As I try to dicipline myself, so does the story. Parallels can be found anywhere, yet, oddly, nowhere as uninteresting as here. You can always wonder what would happen if a teacher gave you a homework, and the homework is an essay about a book, and you do the homework, and you show some things of the sort I’m webbing about in here.
So I digress; the story makes it harder and harder to let go, as if it wasn’t hard enough for such a short book. We are at sea and I’m just fishing for the biggest word (up). I just can’t wait to read the next pages. Believe all is true.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Virschi</name><email>davidvirschi@gmail.com</email></author><category term="misc" /><summary type="html">The middle 19 pages are a fishing game.

Everybody should learn to be naive, to be afraid and to seek foolishness. Nothing wrong with that.
When reading these pages it felt like no time at all has passed. You might not wonder what an old man at the sea can have happen and yet there is suspense, there is lick of the lip.
I notice a loneliness in the need for someone and the repeated self given words, wimping for the boy that is not here, yet he knows what he has to do, what he was born to do and which is the right way to die. Strong but simple reminders push the reading forward, they make you feel sure and steady. There is serenity in the story telling, a future that could be foretold. 
Finding it very interesting how, if it tries to guess, it can find clues about what a human is thinking, bits about what was in somebody’s life, his/her perspective of some things, silluettes of some meaningful people; through the work, the art or the writtings of anyone. Simple details are easy to miss or even intentionally fabricated to make you feel
a certain way, everything can be intuitive and nothing can be certain.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Virschi</name><email>davidvirschi@gmail.com</email></author><category term="misc" /><summary type="html">From the last blog I was told how Heminway has died and so in the next 19 pages and further I might be influenced in perspective, but I also gained this new perspective where sometimes going in blind and being surprised in life is better than to know it all.

I’ve read 25 page of “The old man and the sea” and now I will lay my opinions on the writer’s vision in the first quarter of this book. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The first thing I noticed from the very first pages is the way this story is written, very descriptive, but very short phrases. This way of writing was sort of unsettling for me. The naration, that takes place in my head while learning about the characters and the world, is very jerky and gives the perect setting in this sort of simple world with the old man, the boy and the sea, almost making me read to myself as if I am reading to a little kid. The dialogue doesn’t refract from this, the characters answering each other in singular setences. It feels as if you’re giving me more than I am actually reading!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I honestly can’t wait to read the next part of this book tomorrow, to find out more about the meek and deceptively simple old man, the kind boy and what will happen out in this sea, in which the word “sea” alone can drift you very far into the mysterious light blue sky or the dark blue waters that can hide wonders or terrors and to 
never be able to know what a story can lay for you. Thinking and writing about this book, which should be read in one go, while also taking a tormeting break every 20 or so pages, makes me feel maudlin and enhances the “real” of the setting Hemingway tries to convey. Empathizing with the “refresh” the old man feels every day even if he didn’t catch any fish, is heart-warming.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>David Virschi</name><email>davidvirschi@gmail.com</email></author><category term="misc" /><summary type="html">In this very first blog of mine and the very first personal project, I will try to express myself in a manner that I, myself, would find interesting when reading it; and fail miserably.
